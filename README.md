## About "Frontend-Nanodegree-Feedreader" Project
The goal of this project was to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. All of this code was written in /jasmine/spec/feedreader.js file.
The code was written to test the following in the app:
* RSS Feeds
* The menu
* Initial Entries
* New Feed Selection
Once the test runs, the results shows: 7 specs, and 0 failures.
